abstract = {Gorillas are humans' closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution. Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30{\%} of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

abstract = {The strategic importance of the genome sequence of the gray, short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, accrues from both the unique phylogenetic position of metatherian (marsupial) mammals and the fundamental biologic characteristics of metatherians that distinguish them from other mammalian species. Metatherian and eutherian (placental) mammals are more closely related to one another than to other vertebrate groups, and owing to this close relationship they share fundamentally similar genetic structures and molecular processes. However, during their long evolutionary separation these alternative mammals have developed distinctive anatomical, physiologic, and genetic features that hold tremendous potential for examining relationships between the molecular structures of mammalian genomes and the functional attributes of their components. Comparative analyses using the opossum genome have already provided a wealth of new evidence regarding the importance of noncoding elements in the evolution of mammalian genomes, the role of transposable elements in driving genomic innovation, and the relationships between recombination rate, nucleotide composition, and the genomic distributions of repetitive elements. The genome sequence is also beginning to enlarge our understanding of the evolution and function of the vertebrate immune system, and it provides an alternative model for investigating mechanisms of genomic imprinting. Equally important, availability of the genome sequence is fostering the development of new research tools for physical and functional genomic analyses of M. domestica that are expanding its versatility as an experimental system for a broad range of research applications in basic biology and biomedically oriented research.},

abstract = {Two African apes are the closest living relatives of humans: the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus). Although they are similar in many respects, bonobos and chimpanzees differ strikingly in key social and sexual behaviours, and for some of these traits they show more similarity with humans than with each other. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome to study its evolutionary relationship with the chimpanzee and human genomes. We find that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than these are to each other. These regions allow various aspects of the ancestry of the two ape species to be reconstructed. In addition, many of the regions that overlap genes may eventually help us understand the genetic basis of phenotypes that humans share with one of the two apes to the exclusion of the other.},

abstract = {Fossils and molecular data are two independent sources of information that should in principle provide consistent inferences of when evolutionary lineages diverged. Here we use an alternative approach to genetic inference of species split times in recent human and ape evolution that is independent of the fossil record. We first use genetic parentage information on a large number of wild chimpanzees and mountain gorillas to directly infer their average generation times. We then compare these generation time estimates with those of humans and apply recent estimates of the human mutation rate per generation to derive estimates of split times of great apes and humans that are independent of fossil calibration. We date the human–chimpanzee split to at least 7–8 million years and the population split between Neanderthals and modern humans to 400,000–800,000 y ago. This suggests that molecular divergence dates may not be in conflict with the attribution of 6- to 7-million-y-old fossils to the human lineage and 400,000-yold fossils to the Neanderthal lineage.},

abstract = {Interlocus gene conversion is a major evolutionary force that drives the concerted evolution of duplicated genomic regions. Theoretical models have successfully addressed the effects of interlocus gene conversion and the importance of crossover in the evolutionary fate of gene families and duplications, but have not considered complex recombination scenarios, such as the presence of hotspots. To study the interplay between interlocus gene conversion and crossover we have developed a forward-time simulator that allows the exploration of a wide range of interlocus gene conversion rates under different crossover models. Using it, we have analyzed patterns of nucleotide variation and linkage disequilibrium within and between duplicate regions, focusing on a neutral scenario with constant population size and validating our results with the existing theoretical models. We show that the interaction of gene conversion and crossover is non-trivial and that the location of crossover junctions is a fundamental determinant of levels of variation and linkage disequilibrium in duplicated regions. We also show that if crossover activity between duplications is strong enough, recurrent interlocus gene conversion events can break linkage disequilibrium within duplicates. Given the complex nature of interlocus gene conversion and crossover, we provide a framework to explore their interplay in order to help increase knowledge on molecular evolution within segmental duplications under more complex scenarios, such as demographic changes or natural selection.},

abstract = {Although the phylogenetic relationships of major lineages of primate species are relatively well established, the times of divergence of these lineages as estimated by molecular data are still controversial. This controversy has been generated in part because different authors have used different types of molecular data, different statistical methods, and different calibration points. We have therefore examined the effects of these factors on the estimates of divergence times and reached the following conclusions: (1) It is advisable to concatenate many gene sequences and use a multigene gamma distance for estimating divergence times rather than using the individual gene approach. (2) When sequence data from many nuclear genes are available, protein sequences appear to give more robust estimates than DNA sequences. (3) Nuclear proteins are generally more suitable than mitochondrial proteins for time estimation. (4) It is important first to construct a phylogenetic tree for a group of species using some outgroups and then estimate the branch lengths. (5) It appears to be better to use a few reliable calibration points rather than many unreliable ones. Considering all these factors and using two calibration points, we estimated that the human lineage diverged from the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, Old World monkey, and New World monkey lineages approximately 6 MYA (with a range of 5-7), 7 MYA (range, 6-8), 13 MYA (range, 12-15), 23 MYA (range, 21-25), and 33 MYA (range 32-36).},

abstract = {Pseudogenes are remnants of gene duplication (nonprocessed pseudogenes) and retrotransposition (processed pseudogenes) events. This study describes methods for identifying gene conversion candidates from predicted pseudogenes. Pseudogenes may accumulate and harbor sequence variations over time that become disease- causing mutations when transferred to genes by gene conversion. Atotal of 14,476 pseudogenes were identified, including 3,426 nonprocessed pseudogenes. In addition, 1,945 nonprocessed pseudogenes that are localized near their progenitor gene were evaluated for their possible role in gene conversion and disease. All 11 known, human cases of gene conversion (with deleterious effects) involving pseudogenes were successfully identified by these methods. Among the pseudogenes identified is a retinitis pigmentosa 9 (RP9) pseudogene that carries a c.509A4G mutation which produces a p.Asp170Gly substitution that is associated with the RP9 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). The c.509A4G mutation in RP9 is a previously unrecognized example of gene conversion between the progenitor gene and its pseudogene. Notably, two processed pseudogenes also contain mutations associated with diseases. An inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) pseudogene carries a c.676G4A mutation that produces a p.Asp226Asn substitution that causes the retinitis pigmentosa 10 (RP10) form of adRP; and a phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) pseudogene (PGK1P1) carries a c.837T4C mutation that produces a p.Ile252Thr substitution that is associated with a phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency. Ranking of nonprocessed pseudogenes as candidates for gene conversion was also performed based on the sequence characteristics of published cases of pseudogene- mediated gene conversion.
